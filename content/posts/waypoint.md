In grade school, the first page of my class notebooks was always written in deliberate, delicate handwriting and neat page formatting. There were times when, despite our class having already progressed a week or two into the semester, I delayed writing anything down until the day came when the class’s content/lecture was “right” enough for me to markup the first page. To err on the first page was to sully the entire semester!

This youthful behavior was, of course, mostly trivial. But I think some can relate to that underlying anxiousness, the fear of taking an irreversible misstep before beginning something that holds a certain level personal significance. It's especially true for these current adult-ing things we do now that are beyond the privacy of a notebook, in the public square, and having once begun, cannot be easily re-raveled. (made up that last word)

ALERT: I promise this isn't a meta post about my "journey" of starting this blog. Not only would that have been trope-y, but also lazy and embarrassing and good thing it only crossed my mind once.

This week marks two years since moving to Houston post-college, and my irreversible first step is now already few paces behind me. The only thing is, I don’t know where I’m going, nor do I really know where I am yikes oops whoops. Comfortingly, I’m among peers where this feeling is not uncommon – uncertainty also loves company, maybe. But I'm undecided on how to feel about this part: I think any of the alternative steps I could’ve taken two years ago would have ultimately led me to this same non-place place.

Which means that a prior step was a misstep? Or maybe the recent steps have been a loop? Or I should stop using this metaphor? I don’t know. I’m hopeful that this un-place will actually prove to be a waypoint, and if so, I can only make myself ready for what’s further along.
