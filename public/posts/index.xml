      <description>In grade school, the first page of my class notebooks was always written in deliberate, delicate handwriting and neat page formatting. There were times when, despite our class having already progressed a week or two into the semester, I delayed writing anything down until the day came when the class’s content/lecture was “right” enough for me to markup the first page. To err on the first page was to sully the entire semester!</description>
